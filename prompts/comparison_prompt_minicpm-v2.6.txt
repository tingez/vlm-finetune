You are given two chart images: `<image_00>` and `<image_01>`.

Your task is to **compare the semantic content** of these charts and determine how similar they are in terms of their **underlying data and structure**, not appearance.

### Please follow these detailed instructions:

#### Focus on:

1. **Axes and Labels**: Are axis ranges, units, and labels (e.g., x-axis and y-axis) similar?
2. **Data Points**: Are key data points or trends (peaks, slopes, patterns) significantly different?
3. **Subtle Differences**: Carefully identify small but meaningful changes in data that affect the chartsâ€™ shapes or conclusions.

#### Ignore:

* **Color differences** between the charts.
* **Order of data points**, if the x-axis uses **discrete categories**.
* **Rotation of axes**: The x and y axes might be rotated (swapped) by 90 degrees.

### Output Format:

Please return your response in this format:

```json
{
  "similarity_score": <float between 0 and 1>,
  "difference_summary": "<concise description of the significant differences>"
}
```
